ggplot(data = MTHFR, aes(x = Position, y = Allele.Count, color = VEP.Annotation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + scale_y_log10() #this is the code for Figure 2 so far. I'm having problems as the data is quite skewed and makes it so that much smaller numbers don't appear to even show up. Do we maybe want to exclude values under a certain number?
