ggplot(data = MTHFR, aes(x = Position, y = Allele.Count, color = VEP.Annotation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + scale_y_log10() #this is the code for Figure 2 so far. I'm having problems as the data is quite skewed and makes it so that much smaller numbers don't appear to even show up. Do we maybe want to exclude values under a certain number?
ggplot(MTHFR, aes(Position, Allele.Count, fill = VEP.Annotation)) + geom_col(width=10) + theme_pubr() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(11850650, 11863650, by=3000)) + scale_y_continuous(trans='log10') + ylab("Allele Count") + ggtitle("Mutation Types in MTHFR Gene") + theme(legend.position = "right" , plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + scale_fill_discrete(name = "Mutation Type")
